4. Methodology
LINE DIAGRAM: In a simple line diagram, we plot each pair of values in the xy plane. The plotted
points are then joined successively by line segments and the resulting chart is known as a line
diagram.

MULTIPLE LINE DIAGRAM: In a multiple line graph, more than one dependent variable is
charted on the graph and compared over a single independent variable (often time). Different
dependent variables are often given different coloured lines to distinguish between each data set.
COMPONENT BAR DIAGRAM: MULTIPLE BAR DIAGRAM: A multiple bar diagram is a bar chart in which multiple data sets are represented by drawing the bars side by side in a cluster.
A component bar chart is used to represent data in which the
total magnitude is divided into different components.

SCATTER PLOT: Scatter plots are the graphs that present the relationship between two variables
in a data-set. It represents data points on a two-dimensional plane or on a Cartesian system. The
independent variable or attribute is plotted on the X-axis, while the dependent variable is plotted on the Y-axis.

REGRESSION PLOTS: Regression plots as the name suggests creates a regression line between 2
parameters and helps to visualize their linear relationships.

TREND: Trend is a pattern in data that shows the movement of a series to relatively higher or lower
values over a long period of time. In other words, a trend is observed when there is an increasing or decreasing slope in the time series. The use of a trend line can help predict future or unknown values.
Formula: Y = a+ b*t

SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION: In statistics, simple linear regression is a linear regression
model with a single explanatory variable. That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with
one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a
Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as
accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent
variable. The adjective simple refers to the fact that the outcome variable is related to a single
predictor.
Formula: Y=β0 + β1∗X1 + ϵ

MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION: Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as
multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the
outcome of a response variable. Multiple regressions are an extension of linear (OLS) regression that
uses just one explanatory variable.
Formula: Y=β0 + β1∗X1 + β2∗X2 + … + βp∗Xp

POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION: Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which
the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an
nth degree polynomial in x.
The appropriate model is f(x) = c0 + c1 x + c2 x2 +⋯+ cn xn where ci are the parameters of the model for all i =1(1)n.

MULTICOLINEARITY: In statistics, multicollinearity is a phenomenon in which one predictor
variable in a multiple regression model can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy.
